# Neocities tools

Tools for easing management of a neocities site.

Tools:
- ```ncpush```: pushes the current directory (or the first argument) to neocities, recursively
- ```ncrender```: a static blog generator. Reads from ```posts``` and outputs to ```render/posts```, and also generates ```render/{archive.html,index.html,rss.xml}. Edit the file to change the template.```

Dependencies:
- ```python3```
- ```curl```
